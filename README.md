## Overview

This is not the first FrontEndMentor challenge I have completed, but it is the first I am submitting!

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

After reading the challenge and checking out the reference images, I built a basic outline in HTML. From there, I styled it with vanilla CSS before adding functionality with JS. Note that the success screen is not its own page, but a hidden div. I don't yet know if this is not good practice, but I await constructive criticism by the community.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to solidify the mobile-first approach, and I think I did a good job matching the references. I want to get better about multipage designs and learn best practices for success screens vs subheading pages vs new pages (ie. when to use hidden tags vs make a new HTML file). I'm still pretty new to this, but I am feeling good about structural design for something as simple for this project. If you have tips about ways I can optimize and improve, please let me know!
